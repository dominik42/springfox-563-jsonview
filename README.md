# springfox-563-jsonview

This repository documents the issue [Springfox issue #563](https://github.com/springfox/springfox/issues/563)

There is a mockMvc based test demonstrating the expected result of the two REST API requests.

If you afterwards start the swagger UI http://localhost/8080/api/swagger-ui.html there are no difference between the both methods
but it should.
